Poking around with the Docker tutorial it felt underwhelming to leave it at the default whalesay image it has you make.  I decided to add python and Charlie Sheen to spice it up.

Now it scrapes text from '[The Vatican Assassin Lorem Ipsum](http://vaticanassass.in)' page and uses that instead of ```fortune -a```
